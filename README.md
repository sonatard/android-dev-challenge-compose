## :scroll: Description
- You can see and fav puppies in top page.
- You can see puupy's some info and neiborhoods puppies in detail page.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
- I've never seen a full-screen photo layout on Android, so I challenged it.
- Jetpack Compose does not have a non-scrolling [VerticalGrid](https://github.com/sonatard/android-dev-challenge-compose/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/androiddevchallenge/layout/VerticalGrid.kt) layout, so I made it myself.
  - I also made it possible to pass a gap argument to Grid. This makes it possible to design beautiful layouts.
    - Blue is 16.dp Colulmn padding, Magenta is 16.dp Spacer, Green is 16.dp gap in VerticalGrid <img src="/results/grid_layout.png" width="260">
